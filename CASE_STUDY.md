# üöó Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis ‚Äì Detailed Case Study

## üîé Problem
The electric vehicle market is expanding rapidly, but stakeholders often lack clarity on **who is buying, where adoption is growing, and what factors drive adoption**.  
This project analyzes EV registration data to uncover **trends, market share, and policy impacts** that can guide businesses, policymakers, and infrastructure planners.

## üìä Data
- **Source**: EV Registration Dataset (~150K records)  
- **Key Fields**:  
  - Vehicle type (BEV / PHEV)  
  - Model year & make  
  - Electric range (Km)  
  - MSRP (if available)  
  - State, county, city  
  - CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility  

---

## üõ† Approach
1. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and imported dataset into Power BI.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Created measures for adoption trends, range distribution, BEV vs PHEV splits.  
3. **Dashboard Design**: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with filters by city, utility, and vehicle type.  
4. **Business Context**: Framed insights around market share, adoption by geography, and policy-driven eligibility.
