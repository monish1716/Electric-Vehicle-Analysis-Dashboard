#  Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis – Detailed Case Study

##  Problem
EV adoption is rising—but how does it differ by vehicle type (BEV vs PHEV), range vs price, geography, and manufacturers? This project aims to uncover actionable policy and business insights using real-world EV registration data.

---

##  Data
- **Source**: `Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv` (~150k records)  
- **Key fields**: Registration date, vehicle type (BEV/PHEV), electric range, MSRP, manufacturer, location (state, county), CAFV eligibility.

---

##  Approach
1. **Data Cleaning & Import** in Power BI (or pre-processing as needed).  
2. **Dashboard Analysis**:
   - Trends by state, county, city
   - BEV vs PHEV comparison
   - Range vs price correlation
   - Manufacturer & model popularity
   - CAFV eligibility mapping  
3. **Visual Presentation**: Interactive Power BI visuals for deep-dive exploration.

##  Key Insights
- EV registrations are trending upward across nearly all states, with sharp growth in certain regions.  
- A clear positive correlation between electric range and MSRP—higher range command higher price.  
- BEVs dominate adoption, but PHEVs still retain a foothold, especially in specific markets.  
- A small group of manufacturers accounts for the majority of EV registrations.  
- CAFV eligibility hotspots align with areas having strong EV penetration.

---

##  Business / Policy Actions
- **Focus incentives** on high-growth states to accelerate adoption further.  
- **Align pricing strategies**: Position long-range EVs in premium segments; offer subsidies for mid-range models.  
- **Manufacturer opportunity**: Partner with or support emerging players driving PHEV sales in underrepresented regions.  
- **Infrastructure strategy**: Target CAFV-eligible areas for charging infrastructure rollout to sustain adoption trends.
